# Using Bottlerocket with Amazon ECS<a name="ecs-bottlerocket"></a>

Bottlerocket is a Linux\-based open source operating system that is purpose\-built by AWS for running containers\. For more information, see [Bottlerocket OS](https://github.com/bottlerocket-os/bottlerocket) on GitHub\.

An Amazon ECS\-optimized AMI variant of the Bottlerocket operating system is provided as an AMI you can use when launching Amazon ECS container instances\. For a detailed walkthrough of how to get started with the Bottlerocket operating system on Amazon ECS, see [Using a Bottlerocket AMI with Amazon ECS](https://github.com/bottlerocket-os/bottlerocket/blob/develop/QUICKSTART-ECS.md) on GitHub\.

You can request new features on the GitHub page\. For more information, see [Bottlerocket Issues](https://github.com/bottlerocket-os/bottlerocket/issues) on GitHub\.

## Amazon ECS\-optimized Bottlerocket AMI variants<a name="ecs-bottlerocket-variants"></a>

You can use the following Amazon ECS\-optimized Bottlerocket AMI variants for your Amazon EC2 instances\.
+ `aws-ecs-1`
+ `aws-ecs-1-nvidia`

  For more information about the `aws-ecs-1-nvidia` variant, see [Announcing NVIDIA GPU support for Bottlerocket on Amazon ECS](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/containers/announcing-nvidia-gpu-support-for-bottlerocket-on-amazon-ecs/)\.

## Considerations<a name="ecs-bottlerocket-considerations"></a>

Consider the following when using a Bottlerocket AMI with Amazon ECS\.
+ Bottlerocket is optimized for container workloads and has a focus on security\. It does not include a package manager and is immutable by default\. For information about the security features and guidance, see [Security Features](https://github.com/bottlerocket-os/bottlerocket/blob/develop/SECURITY_FEATURES.md) and [Security Guidance](https://github.com/bottlerocket-os/bottlerocket/blob/develop/SECURITY_GUIDANCE.md) on the GitHub website\.
+ Amazon EC2 instances with x86 or arm64 processors are supported\.
+ Amazon EC2 instances with Inferentia chips are not supported\.
+ The `awsvpc` network mode is supported when using Bottlerocket AMI version `1.1.0` or later\.
+ FireLens is supported when using Bottlerocket AMI version `1.13.0` or later\.
+ The `initProcessEnabled` task definition parameter is not supported\.
+ The following features are not supported:
  + App Mesh in task definitions
  + ECS Anywhere
  + ECS Exec
  + Amazon EFS file system volumes
  + Amazon EFS in encrypted mode and `awsvpc` network mode
  + Elastic Inference

## Retrieving an Amazon ECS\-optimized Bottlerocket AMI<a name="ecs-bottlerocket-retrieve-ami"></a>

You can use one of the following ways to retrieve an Amazon ECS\-optimized Bottlerocket AMI variant\.
+ Use AWS Systems Manager parameters in a AWS CLI command
+ Click the AMI link for a specific region, variant, and architecture in the tables on this page

### Retrieving the `aws-ecs-1` Bottlerocket AMI variant<a name="ecs-bottlerocket-aws-ecs-1-variant"></a>

#### Use AWS Systems Manager parameters in a AWS CLI command<a name="w193aac20c19c25c13b7b1b3"></a>

Use AWS Systems Manager parameters in the following AWS CLI command to retrieve the latest stable `aws-ecs-1` Bottlerocket AMI variant by Region and architecture\. To retrieve a version other than the latest, replace `latest` with the version number\.
+ For the 64\-bit \(`x86_64`\) architecture:

  ```
  aws ssm get-parameter --region us-east-1 --name "/aws/service/bottlerocket/aws-ecs-1/x86_64/latest/image_id" --query Parameter.Value --output text
  ```
+ For the 64\-bit ARM \(`arm64`\) architecture:

  ```
  aws ssm get-parameter --region us-east-1 --name "/aws/service/bottlerocket/aws-ecs-1/arm64/latest/image_id" --query Parameter.Value --output text
  ```

#### Click the AMI link<a name="w193aac20c19c25c13b7b1b5"></a>

The following table provides a link to retrieve the latest Amazon ECS\-optimized Bottlerocket AMI variant `aws-ecs-1`, by Region and architecture\.
