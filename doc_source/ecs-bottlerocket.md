# Using Bottlerocket with Amazon ECS<a name="ecs-bottlerocket"></a>


|  | 
| --- |
| The Bottlerocket AMI variant is in developer preview release for Amazon ECS and is subject to change\. | 

Bottlerocket is a Linux\-based open source operating system that is purpose\-built by AWS for running containers\. For more information, see [Bottlerocket on GitHub](https://github.com/bottlerocket-os/bottlerocket)\.

An Amazon ECS\-optimized AMI variant of the Bottlerocket operating system is provided as an AMI you can use when launching Amazon ECS container instances\. For a detailed walkthrough of how to get started with the Bottlerocket operating system on Amazon ECS, see [Using a Bottlerocket AMI with Amazon ECS ](https://github.com/bottlerocket-os/bottlerocket/blob/develop/QUICKSTART-ECS.md)\.

You can request new features on the GitHub page\. For more information, see [Bottlerocket on GitHub](https://github.com/bottlerocket-os/bottlerocket/issues)\.

## Considerations<a name="ecs-bottlerocket-considerations"></a>

+ The Amazon ECS variant of the Bottlerocket AMI is not supported in the following Regions:
  + China \(Beijing\) \(`cn-north-1`\)
  + China \(Ningxia\) \(`cn-northwest-1`\)
  + AWS GovCloud \(US\-East\) \(`us-gov-east-1`\)

## Retrieving the Bottlerocket AMI<a name="ecs-bottlerocket-retrieve"></a>

The Amazon ECS variant of the Bottlerocket AMI can be retrieved using a Systems Manager parameter\. The following is the format of the parameter name\.

```
/aws/service/bottlerocket/aws-ecs-1/x86_64/latest
```

You can retrieve the latest stable Bottlerocket AMI using the AWS CLI with the following command\.

```
aws ssm get-parameters --name "/aws/service/bottlerocket/aws-ecs-1/x86_64/latest/image_id" --region us-east-1
```

The following table provides a link to retrieve the latest AMI ID of the Amazon ECS variant of the Bottlerocket operating system by Region\.
