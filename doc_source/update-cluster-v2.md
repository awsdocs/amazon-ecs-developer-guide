# Updating a cluster using the console<a name="update-cluster-v2"></a>

You can modify the following cluster properties:
+ Set a default capacity provider

  Each cluster can have one or more capacity providers and an optional capacity provider strategy\. The capacity provider strategy determines how the tasks are spread across the cluster's capacity providers\. When you run a standalone task or create a service, you either use the cluster's default capacity provider strategy or a capacity provider strategy that overrides the default one\.

  Capacity providers are an alternative to launch types\. For more information, see [Capacity provider concepts](cluster-capacity-providers.md#capacity-providers-concepts)\.
+ Turn on Container Insights\.

  CloudWatch Container Insights collects, aggregates, and summarizes metrics and logs from your containerized applications and microservices\. Container Insights also provides diagnostic information, such as container restart failures, that you use to isolate issues and resolve them quickly\. For more information, see [Amazon ECS CloudWatch Container Insights](cloudwatch-container-insights.md)\.
+ Add tags to help you identify your clusters\.
