# Infrastructure Security in Amazon Elastic Container Service<a name="infrastructure-security"></a>

As a managed service, Amazon Elastic Container Service is protected by the AWS global network security\. For information about AWS security services and how AWS protects infrastructure, see [AWS Cloud Security](http://aws.amazon.com/security/)\. To design your AWS environment using the best practices for infrastructure security, see [Infrastructure Protection](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/security-pillar/infrastructure-protection.html) in *Security Pillar AWS Well‚ÄêArchitected Framework*\.

You use AWS published API calls to access Amazon ECS through the network\. Clients must support the following:
+ Transport Layer Security \(TLS\) 1\.0 or later\. We recommend TLS 1\.2 or later\.
+ Cipher suites with perfect forward secrecy \(PFS\) such as DHE \(Ephemeral Diffie\-Hellman\) or ECDHE \(Elliptic Curve Ephemeral Diffie\-Hellman\)\. Most modern systems such as Java 7 and later support these modes\.

Additionally, requests must be signed by using an access key ID and a secret access key that is associated with an IAM principal\. Or you can use the [AWS Security Token Service](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/STS/latest/APIReference/Welcome.html) \(AWS STS\) to generate temporary security credentials to sign requests\.

You can call these API operations from any network location\. Amazon ECS supports resource\-based access policies, which can include restrictions based on the source IP address, so make sure that the policies account for the IP address for the network location\. You can also use Amazon ECS policies to control access from specific Amazon Virtual Private Cloud endpoints or specific VPCs\. Effectively, this isolates network access to a given Amazon ECS resource from only the specific VPC within the AWS network\. For more information, see [Amazon ECS interface VPC endpoints \(AWS PrivateLink\)](vpc-endpoints.md)\.
