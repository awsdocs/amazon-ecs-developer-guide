# Troubleshooting Service Load Balancers<a name="troubleshoot-service-load-balancers"></a>

Amazon ECS services can register tasks with an Elastic Load Balancing load balancer\. Load balancer configuration errors are common causes for stopped tasks\. If your stopped tasks were started by services that use a load balancer, consider the following possible causes\.

**Important**  
Container health checks are not supported for tasks that are part of a service that is configured to use a Classic Load Balancer\. The Amazon ECS service scheduler ignores tasks in an `UNHEALTHY` state that are behind a Classic Load Balancer\.

Improper IAM permissions for the `ecsServiceRole` IAM role  
The `ecsServiceRole` allows Amazon ECS services to register container instances with Elastic Load Balancing load balancers\. You must have the proper permissions set for this role\. For more information, see [Amazon ECS Service Scheduler IAM Role](service_IAM_role.md)\.

Container instance security group  
If your container is mapped to port 80 on your container instance, your container instance security group must allow inbound traffic on port 80 for the load balancer health checks to pass\. 

Incorrect Load Balancer Scheme
Load Balancers that are `internet-facing` require public IP addresses on the nodes they point to. If your nodes do not have public IP addresses, you will need to use the `internal` Load Balander Scheme.

Elastic Load Balancing load balancer not configured for all Availability Zones  
Your load balancer should be configured to use all of the Availability Zones in a region, or at least all of the Availability Zones in which your container instances reside\. If a service uses a load balancer and starts a task on a container instance that resides in an Availability Zone that the load balancer is not configured to use, the task never passes the health check and it is killed\.

Elastic Load Balancing load balancer health check misconfigured  
The load balancer health check parameters can be overly restrictive or point to resources that do not exist\. If a container instance is determined to be unhealthy, it is removed from the load balancer\. Be sure to verify that the following parameters are configured correctly for your service load balancer\.    
Ping Port  
The **Ping Port** value for a load balancer health check is the port on the container instances that the load balancer checks to determine if it is healthy\. If this port is misconfigured, the load balancer likely deregisters your container instance from itself\. This port should be configured to use the `hostPort` value for the container in your service's task definition that you are using with the health check\.  
Ping Path  
This value is often set to `index.html`, but if your service does not respond to that request, then the health check fails\. If your container does not have an `index.html` file, you can set this to `/` to target the base URL for the container instance\.  
Response Timeout  
This is the amount of time that your container has to return a response to the health check ping\. If this value is lower than the amount of time required for a response, the health check fails\.  
Health Check Interval  
This is the amount of time between health check pings\. The shorter your health check intervals are, the faster your container instance can reach the **Unhealthy Threshold**\.  
Unhealthy Threshold  
This is the number of times your health check can fail before your container instance is considered unhealthy\. If you have an unhealthy threshold of 2, and a health check interval of 30 seconds, then your task has 60 seconds to respond to the health check ping before it is assumed unhealthy\. You can raise the unhealthy threshold or the health check interval to give your tasks more time to respond\.

Unable to update the service *servicename*: Load balancer container name or port changed in task definition  
If your service uses a load balancer, the load balancer configuration defined for your service when it was created cannot be changed\. If you update the task definition for the service, the container name and container port that were specified when the service was created must remain in the task definition\.  
To change the load balancer name, the container name, or the container port associated with a service load balancer configuration, you must create a new service\.
