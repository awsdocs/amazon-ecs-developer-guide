# Deregistering a task definition revision<a name="deregister-task-definition"></a>

| The new experience is now the default in the Amazon ECS console\. For more information, see [Deregistering a task definition revision using the console](deregister-task-definition-v2.md)\. | 

If you decide that you no longer need a specific task definition revision in Amazon ECS, you can deregister the task definition revision so that it no longer displays in your `ListTaskDefinition` API calls or in the console when you want to run a task or update a service\.

When you deregister a task definition revision, it's immediately marked as `INACTIVE`\. Existing tasks and services that reference an `INACTIVE` task definition revision continue to run without disruption\. Existing services that reference an `INACTIVE` task definition revision can still scale up or down by modifying the service's desired count\.

You can't use an `INACTIVE` task definition revision to run new tasks or create new services\. You also can't update an existing service to reference an `INACTIVE` task definition revision\. This is despite that there might be up to a 10\-minute window following deregistration where these restrictions have not already taken effect\.

**Note**  
You canâ€™t deregister a task definition family at one time\. You can only deregister individual revisions or multiple revisions within the family\. When you deregister all revisions, the task definition family is moved to the `INACTIVE` list\. Adding a new revision of an `INACTIVE` task definition moves the task definition family back to the `ACTIVE` list\.  
At this time, `INACTIVE` task definition revisions remain discoverable in your account indefinitely\. However, this behavior is subject to change in the future\. Therefore, don't rely on `INACTIVE` task definition revisions persisting beyond the lifecycle of any associated tasks and services\.
