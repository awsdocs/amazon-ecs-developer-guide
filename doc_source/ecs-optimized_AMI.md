# Amazon ECS\-optimized AMI<a name="ecs-optimized_AMI"></a>

Amazon ECS provides the Amazon ECS\-optimized AMIs that are preconfigured with the requirements and recommendations to run your container workloads on Amazon ECS Linux instances\. We recommend that you use the Amazon ECS\-optimized Amazon Linux 2 AMI for your Amazon EC2 instances unless your application requires a specific operating system or a Docker version that is not yet available in that AMI\.

Although you can create your own Amazon EC2 instance AMI that meets the basic specifications needed to run your containerized workloads on Amazon ECS, the Amazon ECS\-optimized AMIs are preconfigured and tested on Amazon ECS by AWS engineers\. It is the simplest way for you to get started and to get your containers running on AWS quickly\.

The Amazon ECS\-optimized AMI metadata, including the AMI name, Amazon ECS container agent version, and Amazon ECS runtime version which includes the Docker version, for each variant can be retrieved programmatically\. For more information, see [Retrieving Amazon ECS\-Optimized AMI metadata](retrieve-ecs-optimized_AMI.md)\.

**Important**  
The Amazon ECS\-optimized Amazon Linux 2023 AMI isn't supported with Service Connect\. This is because the Service Connect agent isn't available for Amazon Linux 2023\.

The following variants of the Amazon ECS\-optimized AMI are available for your Amazon EC2 instances\.
