# Using AWS Fargate Capacity Providers<a name="fargate-capacity-providers"></a>

Amazon ECS cluster capacity providers enable you to use both Fargate and Fargate Spot capacity with your Amazon ECS tasks\. For more information about cluster capacity providers, see [Amazon ECS Cluster Capacity Providers](cluster-capacity-providers.md)\.

With Fargate Spot you can run interruption tolerant Amazon ECS tasks at a discounted rate compared to the Fargate price\. Fargate Spot runs tasks on spare compute capacity\. When AWS needs the capacity back, your tasks will be interrupted with a two\-minute warning\. This is described in further detail below\.

## Fargate Capacity Provider Considerations<a name="fargate-capacity-providers-considerations"></a>

The following should be considered when using Fargate capacity providers\.
+ The Fargate and Fargate Spot capacity providers do not need to be created\. They are available to all accounts and only need to be associated with a cluster to be available for use\.
+ When a new cluster is created using the Amazon ECS console along with the **Networking only** cluster template, the `FARGATE` and `FARGATE_SPOT` capacity providers are associated with the new cluster automatically\.
+ To add the `FARGATE` and `FARGATE_SPOT` capacity providers to an existing cluster, you must use the AWS CLI or API\. For more information, see [Adding Fargate Capacity Providers To An Existing Cluster](#fargate-capacity-providers-existing-cluster)\.
+ Using Fargate Spot requires that your task use platform version 1\.3\.0 or later\. For more information, see [AWS Fargate Platform Versions](platform_versions.md)\.
+ When tasks using the Fargate and Fargate Spot capacity providers are stopped, a task state change event is sent to Amazon EventBridge\. The stopped reason describes the cause\. For more information, see [Task State Change Events](ecs_cwe_events.md#ecs_task_events)\.
+ A cluster may contain a mix of Fargate and Auto Scaling group capacity providers, however a capacity provider strategy may only contain either Fargate or Auto Scaling group capacity providers, but not both\. For more information, see [Auto Scaling Group Capacity Providers](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/cluster-auto-scaling.html#asg-capacity-providers) in the *Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide*\.

## Handling Fargate Spot Termination Notices<a name="fargate-capacity-providers-termination"></a>

When tasks using Fargate Spot capacity are stopped due to a Spot interruption, a two\-minute warning is sent before a task is stopped\. The warning is sent as a task state change event to Amazon EventBridge and a SIGTERM signal to the running task\. When using Fargate Spot as part of a service, the service scheduler will receive the interruption signal and attempt to launch additional tasks on Fargate Spot if capacity is available\.

To ensure that your containers exit gracefully before the task stops, the following can be configured:
+ A `stopTimeout` value of `120` seconds or less can be specified in the container definition that the task is using\. Specifying a `stopTimeout` value gives you time between the moment the task state change event is received and the point at which the container is forcefully stopped\. For more information, see [Container Timeouts](task_definition_parameters.md#container_definition_timeout)\.
+ The SIGTERM signal must be received from within the container to perform any cleanup actions\.

The following is a snippet of a task state change event displaying the stopped reason and stop code for a Fargate Spot interruption\.

    ...
  }
}
```

The following is an event pattern that is used to create an EventBridge rule for Amazon ECS task state change events\. You can optionally specify a cluster in the `detail` field to receive task state change events for\. For more information, see [Creating an EventBridge Rule](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/latest/userguide/create-eventbridge-rule.html) in the *Amazon EventBridge User Guide*\.

{
    "source": [
        "aws.ecs"
    ],
    "detail-type": [
        "ECS Task State Change"
    ],
    "detail": {
        "clusterArn": [

        ]
    }
}
```

## Creating a New Cluster That Uses Fargate Capacity Providers<a name="fargate-capacity-providers-create-cluster"></a>

When a new Amazon ECS cluster is created, you specify one or more capacity providers to associate with the cluster\. The associated capacity providers determine the infrastructure to run your tasks on\.

When using the AWS Management Console, the `FARGATE` and `FARGATE_SPOT` capacity providers are associated with the cluster automatically when using the **Networking Only** cluster template\. For more information, see [Creating a Cluster](create_cluster.md)\.

### To create an Amazon ECS cluster using Fargate capacity providers \(AWS CLI\)<a name="fargate-capacity-providers-create-cluster-cli"></a>

Use the following command to create a new cluster and associate both the Fargate and Fargate Spot capacity providers with it\.
+ [create\-cluster](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ecs/create-cluster.html) \(AWS CLI\)

  ```
  aws ecs create-cluster \
       --cluster-name FargateCluster \
       --capacity-providers FARGATE FARGATE_SPOT \
       --region us-west-2
  ```

## Adding Fargate Capacity Providers To An Existing Cluster<a name="fargate-capacity-providers-existing-cluster"></a>

You can update the pool of available capacity providers for an existing Amazon ECS cluster by using the PutClusterCapacityProviders API\.

Adding either the Fargate or Fargate Spot capacity providers to an existing cluster is not supported in the AWS Management Console\. You must either create a new Fargate cluster in the console or add the Fargate or Fargate Spot capacity providers to the existing cluster using the Amazon ECS API or AWS CLI\.

### To add the Fargate capacity providers to an existing cluster \(AWS CLI\)<a name="fargate-capacity-providers-create-cluster-cli"></a>

Use the following command to add the Fargate and Fargate Spot capacity providers to an existing cluster\. If the specified cluster has existing capacity providers associated with it, you must specify all existing capacity providers in addition to any new ones you want to add\. Any existing capacity providers associated with a cluster that are omitted from a PutClusterCapacityProviders API call will be disassociated from the cluster\. You can only disassociate an existing capacity provider from a cluster if it's not being used by any existing tasks\. These same rules apply to the cluster's default capacity provider strategy\. If the cluster has an existing default capacity provider strategy defined, it must be included in the PutClusterCapacityProviders API call\. Otherwise, it will be overwritten\.
+ [put\-cluster\-capacity\-providers](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ecs/put-cluster-capacity-providers.html) \(AWS CLI\)

  ```
  aws ecs put-cluster-capacity-providers \
       --cluster FargateCluster \
       --capacity-providers FARGATE FARGATE_SPOT existing_capacity_provider1 existing_capacity_provider2 \
       --default-capacity-provider-strategy existing_default_capacity_provider_strategy \
       --region us-west-2
  ```

## Running Tasks Using a Fargate Capacity Provider<a name="fargate-capacity-providers-run-task"></a>

You can run a task or create a service using either the Fargate or Fargate Spot capacity providers by specifying a capacity provider strategy\. If no capacity provider strategy is provided, the cluster's default capacity provider strategy is used\.

Running a task using the Fargate or Fargate Spot capacity providers is supported in the AWS Management Console\. You must add the Fargate or Fargate Spot capacity providers to cluster's default capacity provider strategy if using the AWS Management Console\. When using the Amazon ECS API or AWS CLI you can specify either a capacity provider strategy or use the cluster's default capacity provider strategy\.

### To run a task using a Fargate capacity provider \(AWS CLI\)<a name="fargate-capacity-providers-run-task-cli"></a>

Use the following command to run a task using the Fargate and Fargate Spot capacity providers\.
+ [run\-task](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ecs/run-task.html) \(AWS CLI\)

  ```
  aws ecs run-task \
       --capacity-provider-strategy capacityProvider=FARGATE,weight=1 capacityProvider=FARGATE_SPOT,weight=1 \
       --cluster FargateCluster \
       --task-definition task-def-family:revision \
       --count integer \
       --network-configuration "awsvpcConfiguration={subnets=[string,string],securityGroups=[string,string],assignPublicIp=string}" \
       --region us-west-2
  ```

### Create a service using a Fargate capacity provider \(AWS CLI\)<a name="fargate-capacity-providers-create-service-cli"></a>

Use the following command to create a service using the Fargate and Fargate Spot capacity providers\.
+ [create\-service](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ecs/create-service.html) \(AWS CLI\)

  ```
  aws ecs create-service \
       --capacity-provider-strategy capacityProvider=FARGATE,weight=1 capacityProvider=FARGATE_SPOT,weight=1 \
       --cluster FargateCluster \
       --service-name FargateService \
       --task-definition task-def-family:revision \
       --desired-count integer \
       --network-configuration "awsvpcConfiguration={subnets=[string,string],securityGroups=[string,string],assignPublicIp=string}" \
       --region us-west-2
  ```
