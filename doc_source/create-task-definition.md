# Creating a task definition using the console<a name="create-task-definition"></a>

Create your task definitions using the Amazon ECS console\. To make the task definition creation process as easy as possible, the console has default selections for many choices which we describe below\. There are also help panels available for most of the sections in the console which provide further context\.

You can create a task definition by stepping through the console, or by editing a JSON file\.

## JSON validation<a name="json-validate-for-create"></a>

The Amazon ECS console JSON editor validates the following in the JSON file:
+ The file is a valid JSON file
+ The file does not contain any extraneous keys
+ The file contains the `familyName` parameter
+ There is at least one entry under `containerDefinitions`

## AWS CloudFormation stacks<a name="cloudformation-stack"></a>

The following behavior applies to task definitions created in the new console before January 12, 2023\.

When you create a task definition, the Amazon ECS console automatically creates a CloudFormation stack that has a name that begins with "ECS\-Console\-V2\-TaskDefinition\-"\. If you used the AWS CLI or SDK to deregister the task definition, then you must manually delete the task definition stack\. For more information, see [Deleting a Stack](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/cfn-console-delete-stack.html) in the *AWS CloudFormation User Guide*\.

Task definitions created after January 12, 2023 will not have a CloudFormation stack automatically created\.

#### [ Amazon ECS console ]

1. Open the console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/ecs/v2](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ecs/v2)\.

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Task definitions**

1. Choose **Create new task definition**, **Create new task definition**\.

1. For **Task definition family**, specify a unique name for the task definition\.

1. For each container to define in your task definition, complete the following steps\.

   1. For **Name**, enter a name for the container\.

   1. For **Image URI**, enter the image to use to start a container\. Images in the Amazon ECR Public Gallery registry may be specified using the Amazon ECR Public registry name only\. For example, if `public.ecr.aws/ecs/amazon-ecs-agent:latest` is specified, the Amazon Linux container hosted on Amazon ECR Public Gallery is used\. For all other repositories, specify the repository using either the `repository-url/image:tag` or `repository-url/image@digest` formats\.

   1. If you use a container image in a private registry outside of Amazon ECR, under **Private registry**, turn on **Private registry authentication**\. Then, in **Secrets Manager ARN or name**, enter the Amazon Resource Name \(ARN\) of the secret\.

   1. For **Essential container**, if your task definition has two or more containers defined, you may specify whether the container should be considered essential\. If a container is marked as *essential*, if that container stops then the task is stopped\. Each task definition must contain at least one essential container\.

   1. A port mapping allows the container to access ports on the host to send or receive traffic\. Under **Port mappings**, do one of the following: 
      + When you use the **awsvpc** network mode, for **Container port** and **Protocol**, choose the port mapping to use for the container\.
      + When you use the **bridge** network mode, for **Container port** and **Protocol**, choose the port mapping to use for the container\. You select the **bridge** network mode on the next page\. After you select it, choose **Previous**, and then for **Host port**, specify the port number on the container instance to reserve for your container\.

      Choose **Add more port mappings** to specify additional container port mappings\.

   1. Expand the **Environment variables** section to specify environment variables to inject into the container\. You can specify environment variables either individually using key\-value pairs or in bulk by specifying an environment variable file hosted in an Amazon S3 bucket\. For information on how to format an environment variable file, see [Passing environment variables to a container](taskdef-envfiles.md)\.

   1. \(Optional\) To configure the commands that determine if a container is healthy, expand **HealthCheck**, and then configure the following items:
      + For **Command**, enter a comma\-separated list of commands\. You can start the commands with `CMD` to run the command arguments directly, or `CMD-SHELL` to run the command with the container's default shell\. If neither is specified, `CMD` is used\. 
      + For **Interval**, enter the number of seconds between each health check\. The valid values are between 5 and 30\.
      + For **Timeout**, enter the period of time \(in seconds\) to wait for a health check to succeed before it's considered a failure\. The valid values are between 2 and 60\.
      + For **Start period**, enter the period of time \(in seconds\) to wait for a container to bootstrap before the health check commands run\. The valid values are between 0 and 300\.
      + For **Retries**, enter the number of times to retry the health check commands when there is a failure\. The value values are between 1 and 10\.

   1. \(Optional\) To override some of the values in a Dockerfile, expand **Docker configuration**, and then configure the following items:
      + For **Command**, enter an executable command for a container\. 

        This parameter maps to `Cmd` in the [Create a container](https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.38/#operation/ContainerCreate) section of the Docker Remote API and the `COMMAND` option to `docker run`\. This will override the `CMD` instruction in a [Dockerfile](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#workdir)\.
      + For **Entry point**, enter the Docker ENTRYPOINT that is passed to the container\.

        This parameter maps to `Entrypoint` in the [Create a container](https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.38/#operation/ContainerCreate) section of the Docker Remote API and the `--entrypoint` option to `docker run`\. This will override the `ENTRYPOINT` instruction in a [Dockerfile](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#workdir)\.
      + For **Working directory**, enter the directory that the container will run any entry point and command instructions provided\. 

        This parameter maps to `WorkingDir` in the [Create a container](https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.38/#operation/ContainerCreate) section of the Docker Remote API and the `--workdir` option to `docker run`\. This will override the `WORKDIR` instruction in a [Dockerfile](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#workdir)\.

   1. \(Optional\) Choose **Add more containers** to add additional containers to the task definition\. Choose **Next** once all containers have been defined\.

1. For **App environment**, choose the application environment\. The console default is **AWS Fargate \(serverless\)**\. Amazon ECS performs validation using this value to ensure the task definition parameters are valid for the infrastructure type\.

1. For **Operating system/Architecture**, choose the operating system and CPU architecture for the task\. 

   To run your task on a 64\-bit ARM architecture, select **Linux/ARM64**\. For more information, see [Runtime platform](task_definition_parameters.md#runtime-platform)\.

   To run your **AWS Fargate \(serverless\)** tasks on Windows containers, choose a supported Windows operating system\. For more information, see [Task Operating Systems](AWS_Fargate.md#fargate-task-os)\.

1. For **Task size**, choose the CPU and memory values to reserve for the task\. The CPU value is specified as vCPUs and memory is specified as GB\.

   For tasks hosted on Fargate, the following table shows the valid CPU and memory combinations\.    
[\[See the AWS documentation website for more details\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/create-task-definition.html)

   For tasks hosted on Amazon EC2, supported task CPU values are between 128 CPU units \(0\.125 vCPUs\) and 10240 CPU units \(10 vCPUs\)\.
**Note**  
Task\-level CPU and memory parameters are ignored for Windows containers\.

1. Expand the **Container size** section to enter the amount \(in GB\) of memory to present to the container and the number of CPU units the Amazon ECS container agent will reserve for the container\. 

   For each container, choose **Add**, and then complete the following steps:

   1. For **Container**, choose the container\.

   1. For **CPU**, enter the number of CPU units the Amazon ECS container agent reserves for the container\.

      The total amount of CPU reserved for all containers within a task must be lower than the task\-level **CPU** value\.

      You can multiply the specified value by 1024 to determine the number of CPU units that are available per Amazon EC2 instance type\. For example, the value for a t3 nano instance is 2048\. For more information, see [Amazon EC2 Instances](http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/) \.

   1. For **Memory**, enter the amount of memory, in GB to present to the container\.

      If your container attempts to exceed the memory specified, the container is killed\. The total amount of memory reserved for all containers within a task must be lower than the task **Memory** value, if one is specified\.

   1. For **GPU**, enter the number of GPU units for the container instance\. An Amazon EC2 instance with GPU support has 1 GPU unit for every GPU\. For more information, see [Working with GPUs on Amazon ECS](ecs-gpu.md)\.

1. \(Optional\) Expand the **Task roles, network mode** section to specify the following:

   1. For **Task role**, choose the IAM role to assign to the task\. A task IAM role provides permissions for the containers in a task to call AWS APIs\.

   1. For **Network mode**, choose the network mode to use\. The default is **awsvpc** mode\. For more information, see [Amazon ECS task networking](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/task-networking.html)\.

      If you choose **bridge** for the network mode, choose **Previous**, and then under **Port mappings**, for **Host port**, enter the port number on the container instance to reserve for your container\.

1. \(Optional\) The **Storage** section is used to expand the amount of ephemeral storage for tasks hosted on Fargate as well as add a data volume configuration for the task\.

   1. To expand the available ephemeral storage beyond the default value of 20 GiB for your Fargate tasks, for **Amount**, enter a value up to 200 GiB\.

1. \(Optional\) To add a data volume configuration for the task definition, choose **Add volume**\.    
[\[See the AWS documentation website for more details\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/create-task-definition.html)

1. \(Optional\) Select the **Use log collection** option to specify a log configuration\. For each available log driver, there are log driver options to specify\. The default option sends container logs to CloudWatch Logs\. The other log driver options are configured using AWS FireLens\. For more information, see [Custom log routing](using_firelens.md)\.

   The following describes each container log destination in more detail\.
   + **Amazon CloudWatch** — Configure the task to send container logs to CloudWatch Logs\. The default log driver options are provided which creates a CloudWatch log group on your behalf\. To specify a different log group name, change the driver option values\.
   + **Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose** — Configure the task to send container logs to Kinesis Data Firehose\. The default log driver options are provided which sends logs to an Kinesis Data Firehose delivery stream\. To specify a different delivery stream name, change the driver option values\.
