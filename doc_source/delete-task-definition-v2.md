# Deleting a task definition revision using the console<a name="delete-task-definition-v2"></a>

If you decide that you no longer need a specific task definition revision in Amazon ECS, you can delete the task definition revision so that it no longer displays in your `ListTaskDefinitions` API calls or in the console when you want to run a task or update a service\.

When you delete a task definition revision, it immediately transitions from the `INACTIVE` to `DELETE_IN_PROGRESS`\. Existing tasks and services that reference a `DELETE_IN_PROGRESS` task definition revision continue to run without disruption\. 

You can't use a `DELETE_IN_PROGRESS` task definition revision to run new tasks or create new services\. You also can't update an existing service to reference a `DELETE_IN_PROGRESS` task definition revision\.

**To delete task definitions \(Amazon ECS console\)**
