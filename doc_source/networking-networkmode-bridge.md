# Bridge mode<a name="networking-networkmode-bridge"></a>

With `bridge` mode, you're using a virtual network bridge to create a layer between the host and the networking of the container\. This way, you can create port mappings that remap a host port to a container port\. The mappings can be either static or dynamic\.

With a static port mapping, you can explicitly define which host port you want to map to a container port\. Using the example above, port `80` on the host is being mapped to port `3000` on the container\. To communicate to the containerized application, you send traffic to port `80` to the Amazon EC2 instance's IP address\. From the containerized applicationâ€™s perspective it sees that inbound traffic on port `3000`\.

If you only want to change the traffic port, then static port mappings is suitable\. However, this still has the same disadvantage as using the `host` network mode\. You can't run more than a single instantiation of a task on each host\. This is because a static port mapping only allows a single container to be mapped to port 80\.

To solve this problem, consider using the `bridge` network mode with a dynamic port mapping as shown in the following diagram\.

By not specifying a host port in the port mapping, you can have Docker choose a random, unused port from the ephemeral port range and assign it as the public host port for the container\. For example, the Node\.js application listening on port `3000` on the container might be assigned a random high number port such as `47760` on the Amazon EC2 host\. Doing this means that you can run multiple copies of that container on the host\. Moreover, each container can be assigned its own port on the host\. Each copy of the container receives traffic on port `3000`\. However, clients that send traffic to these containers use the randomly assigned host ports\.

Amazon ECS helps you to keep track of the randomly assigned ports for each task\. It does this by automatically updating load balancer target groups and AWS Cloud Map service discovery to have the list of task IP addresses and ports\. This makes it easier to use services operating using `bridge` mode with dynamic ports\.

However, one disadvantage of using the `bridge` network mode is that it's difficult to lock down service to service communications\. Because services might be assigned to any random, unused port, it's necessary to open broad port ranges between hosts\. However, it's not easy to create specific rules so that a particular service can only communicate to one other specific service\. The services have no specific ports to use for security group networking rules\.

The `bridge` network mode is only supported for Amazon ECS tasks hosted on Amazon EC2 instances\. It is not supported when using Amazon ECS on Fargate\.
