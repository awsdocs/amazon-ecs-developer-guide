# Amazon ECS task placement constraints<a name="task-placement-constraints"></a>

A *task placement constraint* is a rule that's considered during task placement\. Task placement constraints can be specified when either running a task or creating a new service\. The task placement constraints can be updated for existing services as well\. For more information, see [Amazon ECS task placement](task-placement.md)\.

## Constraint types<a name="constraint-types"></a>

Amazon ECS supports the following types of task placement constraints:

`distinctInstance`  
Place each task on a different container instance\. This task placement constraint can be specified when either running a task or creating a new service\.

`memberOf`  
Place tasks on container instances that satisfy an expression\. For more information about the expression syntax for constraints, see [Cluster query language](cluster-query-language.md)\.  
The `memberOf` task placement constraint can be specified with the following actions:  
+ Running a task
+ Creating a new service
+ Creating a new task definition
+ Creating a new revision of an existing task definition

`ecs.os-family`  
LINUX or WINDOWS\_SERVER\_<OS\_Release>\_<FULL or CORE>\.  
The valid values are `LINUX` or `WINDOWS_SERVER_<OS_Release>_<FULL or CORE>`\. For example, `WINDOWS_SERVER_2022_FULL`, `WINDOWS_SERVER_2022_CORE`, `WINDOWS_SERVER_20H2_CORE`, `WINDOWS_SERVER_2019_FULL`, `WINDOWS_SERVER_2019_CORE`, and `WINDOWS_SERVER_2016_FULL`\.  
The `ecs.os-family` task placement constraint can be specified with the following actions:  
+ Running a task
+ Creating a new service
+ Creating a new task definition
+ Creating a new revision of an existing task definition

## Attributes<a name="attributes"></a>

You can add custom metadata to your container instances, known as *attributes*\. Each attribute has a name and an optional string value\. You can use the built\-in attributes provided by Amazon ECS or define custom attributes\.

The following sections contain sample built\-in, optional, and custom attributes\.

### Built\-in attributes<a name="ecs-automatic-attributes"></a>

Amazon ECS automatically applies the following attributes to your container instances\.

`ecs.ami-id`  
The ID of the AMI used to launch the instance\. An example value for this attribute is `ami-1234abcd`\.

`ecs.availability-zone`  
The Availability Zone for the instance\. An example value for this attribute is `us-east-1a`\.

`ecs.instance-type`  
The instance type for the instance\. An example value for this attribute is `g2.2xlarge`\.

`ecs.os-type`  
The operating system for the instance\. The possible values for this attribute are `linux` and `windows`\.

`ecs.cpu-architecture`  
The CPU architecture for the instance\. Example values for this attribute are `x86_64` and `arm64`\.

`ecs.vpc-id`  
The VPC the instance was launched into\. An example value for this attribute is `vpc-1234abcd`\.

`ecs.subnet-id`  
The subnet the instance is using\. An example value for this attribute is `subnet-1234abcd`\.

### Optional attributes<a name="ecs-optional-attributes"></a>

Amazon ECS may add the following attributes to your container instances\.

`ecs.awsvpc-trunk-id`  
If this attribute exists, the instance has a trunk network interface\. For more information, see [Elastic network interface trunking](container-instance-eni.md)\.

`ecs.outpost-arn`  
If this attribute exists, it contains the Amazon Resource Name \(ARN\) of the Outpost\. For more information, see [Amazon Elastic Container Service on AWS Outposts](ecs-on-outposts.md)\.

`ecs.capability.external`  
If this attribute exists, the instance is identified as an external instance\. For more information, see [External instances \(Amazon ECS Anywhere\)](ecs-anywhere.md)\.

### Custom attributes<a name="ecs-custom-attributes"></a>

You can apply custom attributes to your container instances\. For example, you can define an attribute with the name "stack" and a value of "prod"\.

When specifying custom attributes, you must consider the following\.
+ The `name` must contain between 1 and 128 characters and name may contain letters \(uppercase and lowercase\), numbers, hyphens, underscores, forward slashes, back slashes, or periods\.
+ The `value` must contain between 1 and 128 characters and may contain letters \(uppercase and lowercase\), numbers, hyphens, underscores, periods, at signs \(@\), forward slashes, back slashes, colons, or spaces\. The value can't contain any leading or trailing whitespace\.

## Adding an attribute using the classic console<a name="add-attribute"></a>

You can add custom attributes at instance registration time using the container agent or manually, using the AWS Management Console\. For more information about container agent attributes, [Amazon ECS container agent configuration](ecs-agent-config.md)

**To add custom attributes using the classic console**

1. Open the Amazon ECS classic console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/ecs/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ecs/)\.

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Clusters** and select a cluster\.

1. On the **ECS Instances** tab, select the check box for the container instance\.

1. Choose **Actions**, **View/Edit Attributes**\.

1. For each attribute, do the following:

   1. Choose **Add attribute**\.

   1. Enter a name and a value for the attribute and choose the checkmark icon\.

1. When you're finished adding attributes, choose **Close**\.

**Adding custom attributes using the AWS CLI**  
The following examples demonstrate how to add custom attributes using the [put\-attributes](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ecs/put-attributes.html) command\.

**Example: Single Attribute**  
The following example adds the custom attribute "stack=prod" to the specified container instance in the default cluster\.

```
aws ecs put-attributes --attributes name=stack,value=prod,targetId=arn
```

**Example: Multiple Attributes**  
The following example adds the custom attributes "stack=prod" and "project=a" to the specified container instance in the default cluster\.

```
aws ecs put-attributes --attributes name=stack,value=prod,targetId=arn name=project,value=a,targetId=arn
```

## Filtering by attribute using the console<a name="filter-attribute"></a>

You can apply a filter for your container instances, allowing you to see custom attributes\.

**Filter container instances by attribute using the classic console**

1. Open the Amazon ECS classic console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/ecs/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ecs/)\.

1. Choose a cluster that has container instances\.

1. Choose **ECS Instances**\.

1. Set column visibility preferences by choosing the gear icon and selecting the attributes to display\. This setting persists across all container clusters associated with your account\.

1. Using the **Filter by attributes** text field, enter or select the attributes you want to filter by\. The format must be *AttributeName:AttributeValue*\.

   For **Filter by attributes**, enter or select the attributes to filter by\. After you select the attribute name, you're prompted for the attribute value\.

1. Add additional attributes to the filter as needed\. Remove an attribute by choosing the **X** next to it\.

**Filter container instances by attribute using the AWS CLI**  
The following examples demonstrate how to filter container instances by attribute using the [list\-constainer\-instances](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ecs/list-container-instances.html) command\. For more information about the filter syntax, see [Cluster query language](cluster-query-language.md)\.

**Example: Built\-in attribute**  
The following example uses built\-in attributes to list the g2\.2xlarge instances\.

```
aws ecs list-container-instances --filter "attribute:ecs.instance-type == g2.2xlarge"
```

**Example: Custom attribute**  
The following example lists the instances with the custom attribute "stack=prod"\.

```
aws ecs list-container-instances --filter "attribute:stack == prod"
```

**Example: Exclude an attribute value**  
The following example lists the instances with the custom attribute "stack" unless the attribute value is "prod"\.

```
aws ecs list-container-instances --filter "attribute:stack != prod"
```

**Example: Multiple attribute values**  
The following example uses built\-in attributes to list the instances of type `t2.small` or `t2.medium`\.

```
aws ecs list-container-instances --filter "attribute:ecs.instance-type in [t2.small, t2.medium]"
```

**Example: Multiple attributes**  
The following example uses built\-in attributes to list the T2 instances in the us\-east\-1a Availability Zone\.

```
aws ecs list-container-instances --filter "attribute:ecs.instance-type =~ t2.* and attribute:ecs.availability-zone == us-east-1a"
```

## Example constraints<a name="constraint-examples"></a>

The following are task placement constraint examples\.

This example uses the `memberOf` constraint to place tasks on T2 instances\. It can be specified with the following actions: [CreateService](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/APIReference/API_CreateService.html), [UpdateService](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/APIReference/API_UpdateService.html), [RegisterTaskDefinition](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/APIReference/API_RegisterTaskDefinition.html), and [RunTask](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/APIReference/API_RunTask.html)\.

```
"placementConstraints": [
    {
        "expression": "attribute:ecs.instance-type =~ t2.*",
        "type": "memberOf"
    }
]
```

The example uses the `memberOf` constraint to place tasks on instances with other tasks in the `databases` task group, respecting any task placement strategies that are also specified\. For more information about task groups, see [Task groups](task-groups.md)\. It can be specified with the following actions: [CreateService](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/APIReference/API_CreateService.html), [UpdateService](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/APIReference/API_UpdateService.html), [RegisterTaskDefinition](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/APIReference/API_RegisterTaskDefinition.html), and [RunTask](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/APIReference/API_RunTask.html)\.

```
"placementConstraints": [
    {
        "expression": "task:group == databases",
        "type": "memberOf"
    }
]
```

The `distinctInstance` constraint places each task in the group on a different instance\. It can be specified with the following actions: [CreateService](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/APIReference/API_CreateService.html), [UpdateService](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/APIReference/API_UpdateService.html), and [RunTask](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/APIReference/API_RunTask.html)

```
"placementConstraints": [
    {
        "type": "distinctInstance"
    }
]
```
