# Amazon EC2 Windows containers<a name="ECS_Windows"></a>

Amazon ECS now supports Windows containers on container instances that are launched with the Amazon ECS\-optimized Windows Server AMI and on AWS Fargate\. For more information about Windows containers on AWS Fargate, see [Windows containers on AWS Fargate considerations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/userguide/what-is-fargate.html#windows-considerations)\.

Windows container instances use their own version of the Amazon ECS container agent\. On the Amazon ECS\-optimized Windows Server AMI, the Amazon ECS container agent runs as a service on the host\. Unlike the Linux platform, the agent doesn't run inside a container because it uses the host's registry and the named pipe at `\\.\pipe\docker_engine` to communicate with the Docker daemon\.

The source code for the Amazon ECS container agent is [available on GitHub](https://github.com/aws/amazon-ecs-agent)\. We encourage you to submit pull requests for changes that you would like to have included\. However, we do not currently provide support for running modified copies of this software\. You can view open issues for Amazon ECS and Windows containers on our [GitHub issues page](https://github.com/aws/amazon-ecs-agent/issues)\.

Amazon ECS vends AMIs that are optimized for Windows containers in the following variants\. For more information, see [Amazon ECS\-optimized AMI](ecs-optimized_AMI.md)\.
+ **Amazon ECS\-optimized Windows Server 2022 Full AMI** – Recommended for launching your Amazon ECS container instances on the Windows operating system\.
+ **Amazon ECS\-optimized Windows Server 2022 Core AMI** – Recommended for launching your Amazon ECS container instances on the Windows operating system\.
+ **Amazon ECS\-optimized Windows Server 2019 Full AMI** – Recommended for launching your Amazon ECS container instances on the Windows operating system\.
+ **Amazon ECS\-optimized Windows Server 2019 Core AMI** – Recommended for launching your Amazon ECS container instances on the Windows operating system\.
+ **Amazon ECS\-optimized Windows Server 2004 Core AMI** – Available for launching your Amazon ECS container instances on the Windows operating system\.
**Important**  
The Amazon ECS\-optimized Windows Server 2004 Core AMI is being deprecated\. No new versions of this AMI will be released\.
+ **Amazon ECS\-optimized Windows Server 1909 Core AMI** – Available for launching your Amazon ECS container instances on the Windows operating system\.
**Important**  
The Amazon ECS\-optimized Windows Server 1909 Core AMI is being deprecated\. No new versions of this AMI will be released\.
+ **Amazon ECS\-optimized Windows Server 2016 Full AMI** – Available for launching your Amazon ECS container instances on the Windows operating system\.

 Windows Server 2022, Windows Server 2019, and Windows Server 2016 are Long\-Term Servicing Channel \(LTSC\) releases\. Windows Server 20H2 is a Semi\-Annual Channel \(SAC\) release\.

## Windows container caveats<a name="windows_caveats"></a>

Here are some things you should know about Amazon EC2 Windows containers and Amazon ECS\.
+ Windows containers can't run on Linux container instances, and the opposite is also the case\. For better task placement for Windows and Linux tasks, keep Windows and Linux container instances in separate clusters and only place Windows tasks on Windows clusters\. You can ensure that Windows task definitions are only placed on Windows instances by setting the following placement constraint: `memberOf(ecs.os-type=='windows')`\.
+ Windows containers are supported for tasks that use the EC2 and Fargate launch types\.
+ Windows containers and container instances can't support all the task definition parameters that are available for Linux containers and container instances\. For some parameters, they aren't supported at all, and others behave differently on Windows than they do on Linux\. For more information, see [Amazon EC2 Windows task definition considerations](windows_task_definitions.md)\.
+ For the IAM roles for tasks feature, you need to configure your Windows container instances to allow the feature at launch\. Your containers must run some provided PowerShell code when they use the feature\. For more information, see [Additional configuration for Windows IAM roles for tasks](windows_task_IAM_roles.md)\.
+ The IAM roles for tasks feature uses a credential proxy to provide credentials to the containers\. This credential proxy occupies port 80 on the container instance, so if you use IAM roles for tasks, port 80 is not available for tasks\. For web service containers, you can use an Application Load Balancer and dynamic port mapping to provide standard HTTP port 80 connections to your containers\. For more information, see [Service load balancing](service-load-balancing.md)\.
+ The Windows Server Docker images are large \(9 GiB\)\. So, your Windows container instances require more storage space than Linux container instances\.
+ To run a Windows container on a Windows Server, the container’s base image OS version must match that of the host\. For more information, see [Windows container version compatibility](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/windowscontainers/deploy-containers/version-compatibility?tabs=windows-server-2022%2Cwindows-10-21H1) on the Microsoft documentation website\. If your cluster runs multiple Windows versions, you can ensure that a task is placed on an EC2 instance running on the same version by using the placement constraint: `memberOf(attribute:ecs.os-family == WINDOWS_SERVER_<OS_Release>_<FULL or CORE>)`\. For more information, see [Retrieving Amazon ECS\-Optimized AMI metadata](retrieve-ecs-optimized_windows_AMI.md)\.
