# Deregistering an external instance using the classic console<a name="ecs-anywhere-deregistration-classic-console"></a>


|  |

| The new experience is now the default in the Amazon ECS console\. For more information, see [Deregistering an external instance](ecs-anywhere-deregistration.md)\. | 

We recommend that, after you finish using an external instance, you deregister the instance from both Amazon ECS and AWS Systems Manager\. Following deregistration, the external instance is no longer able to accept new tasks\.

If you have tasks that are running on the container instance when you deregister it, the tasks remain running until they stop through some other means\. However, these tasks are no longer monitored or accounted for by Amazon ECS\. If these tasks on your external instance are part of an Amazon ECS service, then the service scheduler starts another copy of that task, on a different instance, if possible\.

To register an external instance to a new cluster, after the external instance has been deregistered from both Amazon ECS and Systems Manager, you can clean up the remaining AWS resources on the instance and register it with a new cluster\.

1. Open the Amazon ECS classic console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/ecs/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ecs/)\.

1. From the navigation bar, choose the Region where your external instance is registered\.

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Clusters** and select the cluster that hosts the external instance\.

1. On the **Cluster : *name*** page, choose the **ECS Instances** tab\.  
![\[ECS Instances tab\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/images/ECS_Instances_tab.png)

1. Select the external instance ID to deregister\. You're redirected to the container instance detail page\.

1. On the **Container Instance : *id*** page, choose **Deregister**\.

1. Review the deregistration message\. Select **Deregister from AWS Systems Manager** to also deregister the external instance as an Systems Manager managed instance\. Choose **Deregister**\.
**Note**  
You can deregister the external instance as an Systems Manager managed instance in the Systems Manager console\. For instructions, see [Deregistering managed instances](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/systems-manager-managed-instances-advanced-deregister.html) in the *AWS Systems Manager User Guide*\.

1. If you want to clean up the remaining AWS resources from the external instance, follow these steps\. The cleanup steps must be completed before you can register the external instance with a new cluster\.

After you deregister the instance, clean up AWS resources on your on\-premises server or VM \.
