# Amazon ECS CloudWatch Container Insights<a name="cloudwatch-container-insights"></a>

CloudWatch Container Insights collects, aggregates, and summarizes metrics and logs from your containerized applications and microservices\. The metrics include utilization for resources such as CPU, memory, disk, and network\. The metrics are available in CloudWatch automatic dashboards\. For a full list of Amazon ECS Container Insights metrics, see [Amazon ECS Container Insights Metrics](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/Container-Insights-metrics-ECS.html) in the *Amazon CloudWatch User Guide*\.

Operational data is collected as performance log events\. These are entries that use a structured JSON schema for high\-cardinality data to be ingested and stored at scale\. From this data, CloudWatch creates higher\-level aggregated metrics at the cluster, service, and task level as CloudWatch metrics\. For more information, see [Amazon ECS Container Insights metrics;](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/Container-Insights-metrics-ECS.html) in the *Amazon CloudWatch User Guide*\.

**Important**  
Metrics collected by CloudWatch Container Insights are charged as custom metrics\. For more information about CloudWatch pricing, see [CloudWatch Pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/pricing/)\. Amazon ECS also provides monitoring metrics that are provided at no additional cost\. For more information, see [Amazon ECS CloudWatch metrics](cloudwatch-metrics.md)\.

## Container Insights considerations<a name="cloudwatch-container-insights-considerations"></a>

The following should be considered when using CloudWatch Container Insights\.
+ CloudWatch Container Insights metrics only reflect the resources with running tasks during the specified time range\. For example, if you have a cluster with one service in it but that service has no tasks in a `RUNNING` state, there will be no metrics sent to CloudWatch\. If you have two services and one of them has running tasks and the other doesn't, only the metrics for the service with running tasks will be sent\.
+ Network metrics are available for all tasks run on Fargate and tasks run on Amazon EC2 instances that use either the `bridge` or `awsvpc` network modes\.

## Setting up CloudWatch Container Insights for cluster and service level metrics<a name="cloudwatch-container-insights-working"></a>

Container Insights can be turned on for all new clusters created by opting in to the `containerInsights` account setting, on individual clusters by turning it on during cluster creation, or on existing clusters by using the `UpdateClusterSettings` API\. 

Opting in to the `containerInsights` account setting can be done with both the Amazon ECS console and the AWS CLI\. You must be running version `1.16.200` or later of the AWS CLI to use this feature\. For more information on creating Amazon ECS clusters, see [Creating a cluster using the classic console](create_cluster.md) or [Cluster management in the Amazon ECS console](available-cluster-actions.md)\.

**Important**  
For clusters containing tasks or services using the EC2 launch type, your container instances must be running version 1\.29\.0 or later of the Amazon ECS agent\. For more information, see [Amazon ECS Linux container agent versions](ecs-agent-versions.md)\.

## To change the default for Container Insights for all users using the console<a name="w245aac30c29c15"></a>

You can make all new clusters turn on Container Insights when they are created by all users and roles\. These changes apply to the entire AWS account unless a user or role explicitly overrides these settings for themselves\. Any user on an account can use one of the following steps to modify the default account setting for all users or roles on your account\. The following steps show how to set this default using the AWS Management Console\.

1. Open the console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/ecs/v2](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ecs/v2)\.

1. In the navigation bar at the top, select the Region for which to view your account settings\. 

1. In the navigation page, choose **Account Settings**\.

1. Choose **Update**\.

1. Under **CloudWatch Container Insights**, select **CloudWatch Container Insights**\.
**Important**  
You must give users the `ecs:PutAccountSetting` permission to perform this action\.  
You must give users the `ecs:PutAccountSetting` permission to perform this action\.

1. Choose **Save changes**\.

1. On the confirmation screen, choose **Confirm** to save the selection\.

## To change the default for Container Insights for all users using the command line<a name="w245aac30c29c17"></a>

You can make all new clusters turn on Container Insights when they are created by all IAM users and roles\. These changes apply to the entire AWS account unless a user or role explicitly overrides these settings for themselves\. Any user on an account can use one of the following steps to modify the default account setting for all users or roles on your account\. The following steps show how to set this default using the AWS Command Line Interface\.

1. [put\-account\-setting\-default](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ecs/put-account-setting-default.html) \(AWS CLI\)

   ```
   aws ecs put-account-setting-default --name containerInsights --value enabled --region us-east-1
   ```

1. [Write\-ECSAccountSettingDefault](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/powershell/latest/reference/items/Write-ECSAccountSettingDefault.html) \(AWS Tools for Windows PowerShell\)

   ```
   Write-ECSAccountSettingDefault -Name containerInsights -Value enabled -Region us-east-1 -Force
   ```

## To change the default for Container Insights for a specific user using the command line<a name="w245aac30c29c19"></a>

You can make all new clusters turn on Container Insights when they are created by a specific user or role\. This is useful when a specific role is used by AWS CloudFormation to make all changes in a production account, for example\. The account owner can use one of the following commands and specify the ARN of the principal user or container instance IAM role in the request to modify the account settings\.

1. [put\-account\-setting](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ecs/put-account-setting.html) \(AWS CLI\)

   The following example is for modifying the account setting of a specific user:

   ```
   aws ecs put-account-setting --name containerInsights --value enabled --principal-arn arn:aws:iam::aws_account_id:user/userName --region us-east-1
   ```

1. [Write\-ECSAccountSetting](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/powershell/latest/reference/items/Write-ECSAccountSetting.html) \(AWS Tools for Windows PowerShell\)

   The following example is for modifying the account setting of a specific user:

   ```
   Write-ECSAccountSetting -Name containerInsights -Value enabled -PrincipalArn arn:aws:iam::aws_account_id:user/userName -Region us-east-1 -Force
   ```

## To turn on Container Insights for a specific cluster using the command line<a name="w245aac30c29c21"></a>

Use one of the following commands to turn on Container Insights for a cluster\.
+ [update\-cluster\-settings](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ecs/update-cluster-settings.html) \(AWS CLI\)

  ```
  aws ecs update-cluster-settings --cluster cluster_name_or_arn --settings name=containerInsights,value=enabled|disabled --region us-east-1
  ```
