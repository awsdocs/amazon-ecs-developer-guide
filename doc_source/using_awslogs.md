# Using the awslogs log driver<a name="using_awslogs"></a>

You can configure the containers in your tasks to send log information to CloudWatch Logs\. If you're using the Fargate launch type for your tasks, you can view the logs from your containers\. If you're using the EC2 launch type, you can view different logs from your containers in one convenient location, and it prevents your container logs from taking up disk space on your container instances\. This topic goes over how you can get started using the `awslogs` log driver in your task definitions\.

**Note**  
The type of information that is logged by the containers in your task depends mostly on their `ENTRYPOINT` command\. By default, the logs that are captured show the command output that you typically might see in an interactive terminal if you ran the container locally, which are the `STDOUT` and `STDERR` I/O streams\. The `awslogs` log driver simply passes these logs from Docker to CloudWatch Logs\. For more information about how Docker logs are processed, including alternative ways to capture different file data or streams, see [View logs for a container or service](https://docs.docker.com/config/containers/logging/) in the Docker documentation\.

To send system logs from your Amazon ECS container instances to CloudWatch Logs, see [Monitoring your container instances](using_cloudwatch_logs.md)\. For more information about CloudWatch Logs, see [Monitoring Log Files](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/DeveloperGuide/WhatIsCloudWatchLogs.html) and [CloudWatch Logs quotas](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/logs/cloudwatch_limits_cwl.html) in the *Amazon CloudWatch Logs User Guide*\.

## Turning on the awslogs log driver for your containers<a name="enable_awslogs"></a>

If you're using the Fargate launch type for your tasks, you need to add the required `logConfiguration` parameters to your task definition to turn on the `awslogs` log driver\. For more information, see [Specifying a log configuration in your task definition](#specify-log-config)\.

If you're using the EC2 launch type for your tasks and want to turn on the `awslogs` log driver, your Amazon ECS container instances require at least version 1\.9\.0 of the container agent\. For information about how to check your agent version and updating to the latest version, see [Updating the Amazon ECS container agent](ecs-agent-update.md)\.

**Note**  
If you aren't using the Amazon ECS optimized AMI \(with at least version 1\.9\.0\-1 of the `ecs-init` package\) for your container instances, you also need to specify that the `awslogs` logging driver is available on the container instance when you start the agent by using the following environment variable in your docker run statement or environment variable file\. For more information, see [Installing the Amazon ECS container agent](ecs-agent-install.md)\.  

```
ECS_AVAILABLE_LOGGING_DRIVERS='["json-file","awslogs"]'
```

Your Amazon ECS container instances also require `logs:CreateLogStream` and `logs:PutLogEvents` permission on the IAM role that you can launch your container instances with\. If you created your Amazon ECS container instance role before `awslogs` log driver support was enabled in Amazon ECS, you might need to add this permission\. The `ecsTaskExecutionRole` is used when it's assigned to the task and likely contains the correct permissions\. For information about checking your task execution role, see [Checking for the task execution \(`ecsTaskExecutionRole`\) role in the IAM console](task_execution_IAM_role.md#procedure_check_execution_role)\. If your container instances use the managed IAM policy for container instances, your container instances likely have the correct permissions\. For information about how to check your Amazon ECS container instance role and attach the managed IAM policy for container instances, see [Checking for the container instance \( `ecsInstanceRole`\) in the IAM console](instance_IAM_role.md#procedure_check_instance_role)\.

## Creating a log group<a name="create_awslogs_loggroups"></a>

The `awslogs` log driver can send log streams to an existing log group in CloudWatch Logs or create a new log group on your behalf\. The AWS Management Console provides an auto\-configure option, which creates a log group on your behalf using the task definition family name with `ecs` as the prefix\. Alternatively, you can manually specify your log configuration options and specify the `awslogs-create-group` option with a value of `true`, which creates the log groups on your behalf\.

**Note**  
To use the `awslogs-create-group` option to have your log group created, your task execution IAM role policy or EC2 instance role policy must include the `logs:CreateLogGroup` permission\.

The following code shows how to set the `awslogs-create-group` option\.

```
{
    "containerDefinitions": [
        {
            "logConfiguration": {
                "logDriver": "awslogs",
                "options": {
                    "awslogs-group": "firelens-container",
                    "awslogs-region": "us-west-2",
                    "awslogs-create-group": "true",
                    "awslogs-stream-prefix": "firelens"
                }
            }
}
```

### Using the auto\-configuration feature to create a log group<a name="create_awslogs_loggroups_auto"></a>

When you register a task definition,in the Amazon ECS console, you can allow Amazon ECS to auto\-configure your CloudWatch logs\. Doing this causes a log group to be created on your behalf using the task definition family name with `ecs` as the prefix\. For more information, see [Creating a task definition using the console](create-task-definition.md)\.

## Available awslogs log driver options<a name="create_awslogs_logdriver_options"></a>

The `awslogs` log driver supports the following options in Amazon ECS task definitions\. For more information, see [CloudWatch Logs logging driver](https://docs.docker.com/config/containers/logging/awslogs/)\.

`awslogs-create-group`  
Required: No  
Specify whether you want the log group to be created automatically\. If this option isn't specified, it defaults to `false`\.  
Your IAM policy must include the `logs:CreateLogGroup` permission before you attempt to use `awslogs-create-group`\.

`awslogs-region`  
Required: Yes  
Specify the AWS Region that the `awslogs` log driver is to send your Docker logs to\. You can choose to send all of your logs from clusters in different Regions to a single region in CloudWatch Logs\. This is so that they're all visible in one location\. Otherwise, you can separate them by Region for more granularity\. Make sure that the specified log group exists in the Region that you specify with this option\.

`awslogs-group`  
Required: Yes  
Make sure to specify a log group that the `awslogs` log driver sends its log streams to\. For more information, see [Creating a log group](#create_awslogs_loggroups)\.

`awslogs-stream-prefix`  
Required: Optional for the EC2 launch type, required for the Fargate launch type\.  
Use the `awslogs-stream-prefix` option to associate a log stream with the specified prefix, the container name, and the ID of the Amazon ECS task that the container belongs to\. If you specify a prefix with this option, then the log stream takes the following format\.  

```
prefix-name/container-name/ecs-task-id
```
If you don't specify a prefix with this option, then the log stream is named after the container ID that's assigned by the Docker daemon on the container instance\. Because it's difficult to trace logs back to the container that sent them with just the Docker container ID \(which is only available on the container instance\), we recommend that you specify a prefix with this option\.  
For Amazon ECS services, you can use the service name as the prefix\. Doing so you can trace log streams to the service that the container belongs to, the name of the container that sent them, and the ID of the task that the container belongs to\.  
You must specify a stream\-prefix for your logs to have your logs appear in the Log pane when using the Amazon ECS console\.

`awslogs-datetime-format`  
Required: No  
This option defines a multiline start pattern in Python `strftime` format\. A log message consists of a line that matches the pattern and any following lines that don’t match the pattern\. The matched line is the delimiter between log messages\.  
One example of a use case for using this format is for parsing output such as a stack dump, which might otherwise be logged in multiple entries\. The correct pattern allows it to be captured in a single entry\.  
For more information, see [awslogs\-datetime\-format](https://docs.docker.com/config/containers/logging/awslogs/#awslogs-datetime-format)\.  
You cannot configure both the `awslogs-datetime-format` and `awslogs-multiline-pattern` options\.  
Multiline logging performs regular expression parsing and matching of all log messages\. This might have a negative impact on logging performance\.

`awslogs-multiline-pattern`  
Required: No  
This option defines a multiline start pattern that uses a regular expression\. A log message consists of a line that matches the pattern and any following lines that don’t match the pattern\. The matched line is the delimiter between log messages\.  
For more information, see [awslogs\-multiline\-pattern](https://docs.docker.com/config/containers/logging/awslogs/#awslogs-multiline-pattern)\.  
This option is ignored if `awslogs-datetime-format` is also configured\.  
You cannot configure both the `awslogs-datetime-format` and `awslogs-multiline-pattern` options\.  
Multiline logging performs regular expression parsing and matching of all log messages\. This might have a negative impact on logging performance\.

`mode`  
Required: No  
Valid values: `non-blocking` \| `blocking`  
Default value: `blocking`  
The delivery mode of log messages from the container to `awslogs`\. For more information, see [Configure logging drivers](https://docs.docker.com/config/containers/logging/configure/#configure-the-delivery-mode-of-log-messages-from-container-to-log-driver)\.

`max-buffer-size`  
Required: No  
Default value: `1m`  
When `non-blocking` mode is used, the `max-buffer-size` log option controls the size of the ring buffer that's used for intermediate message storage\.

## Specifying a log configuration in your task definition<a name="specify-log-config"></a>

Before your containers can send logs to CloudWatch, you must specify the `awslogs` log driver for containers in your task definition\. This section describes the log configuration for a container to use the `awslogs` log driver\. For more information, see [Creating a task definition using the console](create-task-definition.md)\.

The task definition JSON that follows has a `logConfiguration` object specified for each container\. One is for the WordPress container that sends logs to a log group called `awslogs-wordpress`\. The other is for a MySQL container that sends logs to a log group that's called `awslogs-mysql`\. Both containers use the `awslogs-example` log stream prefix\.

```
{
    "containerDefinitions": [
        {
            "name": "wordpress",
            "links": [
                "mysql"
            ],
            "image": "wordpress",
            "essential": true,
            "portMappings": [
                {
                    "containerPort": 80,
                    "hostPort": 80
                }
            ],
            "logConfiguration": {
                "logDriver": "awslogs",
                "options": {
                    "awslogs-create-group": "true",
                    "awslogs-group": "awslogs-wordpress",
                    "awslogs-region": "us-west-2",
                    "awslogs-stream-prefix": "awslogs-example"
                }
            },
            "memory": 500,
            "cpu": 10
        },
        {
            "environment": [
                {
                    "name": "MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD",
                    "value": "password"
                }
            ],
            "name": "mysql",
            "image": "mysql",
            "cpu": 10,
            "memory": 500,
            "essential": true,
            "logConfiguration": {
                "logDriver": "awslogs",
                "options": {
                    "awslogs-create-group": "true",
                    "awslogs-group": "awslogs-mysql",
                    "awslogs-region": "us-west-2",
                    "awslogs-stream-prefix": "awslogs-example"
                }
            }
        }
    ],
    "family": "awslogs-example"
}
```

After you have registered a task definition with the `awslogs` log driver in a container definition log configuration, you can run a task or create a service with that task definition to start sending logs to CloudWatch Logs\. For more information, see [Run a standalone task in the classic Amazon ECS console](ecs_run_task.md) and [Creating an Amazon ECS service in the classic console](create-service.md)\.

## Viewing awslogs container logs in CloudWatch Logs<a name="viewing_awslogs"></a>

For tasks using the EC2 launch type, after your container instance role has the proper permissions to send logs to CloudWatch Logs, your container agents are updated to at least version 1\.9\.0, and you have configured and started a task with containers that use the `awslogs` log driver, your configured containers should be sending their log data to CloudWatch Logs\. You can view and search these logs in the console\.

**To view your CloudWatch Logs data for a container from the Amazon ECS console**

1. Open the console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/ecs/v2](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ecs/v2)\.

1. On the **Clusters** page, select the cluster that contains the task to view\.

1. On the **Cluster: *cluster\_name*** page, choose **Tasks**, and then select the task to view\.

1. On the **Task: *task\_id*** page, under **Container details**, choose **Log configuration** to view the logs\.

1. In the **Log Configuration** section, choose **View logs in CloudWatch**, which opens the associated log stream in the CloudWatch console\.

**To view your CloudWatch Logs data in the CloudWatch console**

1. Open the CloudWatch console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/cloudwatch/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/)\.
