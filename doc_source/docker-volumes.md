# Docker Volumes<a name="docker-volumes"></a>

When using Docker volumes, the built\-in `local` driver or a third\-party volume driver can be used\. If a third\-party driver is used, it should be installed on the container instance before the task is launched\. Docker volumes are managed by Docker and a directory is created in `/var/lib/docker/volumes` on the container instance that contains the volume data\. Docker volumes are only supported when using the EC2 launch type\. Windows containers only support the use of the `local` driver\. To use Docker volumes, specify a `dockerVolumeConfiguration` in your task definition\. For more information, see [Using volumes](https://docs.docker.com/storage/volumes/)\.

Some common use cases for Docker volumes are:
+ To provide persistent data volumes for use with containers
+ To share a defined data volume at different locations on different containers on the same container instance
+ To define an empty, nonpersistent data volume and mount it on multiple containers within the same task
+ To provide a data volume to your task that is managed by a third party driver

## Specifying a Docker volume in your Task Definition<a name="specify-volume-config"></a>

Before your containers can use data volumes, you must specify the volume and mount point configurations in your task definition\. This section describes the volume configuration for a container\. For tasks that use a Docker volume, specify a `dockerVolumeConfiguration`\. For tasks that use a bind mount host volume, specify a `host` and optional `sourcePath`\.

The task definition JSON shown below shows the syntax for the `volumes` and `mountPoints` objects for a container\.

```
{
    "containerDefinitions": [
        {
            "mountPoints": [
                {
                    "sourceVolume": "string",
                    "containerPath": "/path/to/mount_volume",
                    "readOnly": boolean
                }
            ]
        }
    ],
    "volumes": [
        {
            "name": "string",
            "host": {
                "sourcePath": "string"
            },
            "dockerVolumeConfiguration": {
                "scope": "string",
                "autoprovision": boolean,
                "driver": "string",
                "driverOpts": {
                    "key": "value"
                },
                "labels": {
                    "key": "value"
                }
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

`name`  
Type: String  
Required: No  
The name of the volume\. Up to 255 letters \(uppercase and lowercase\), numbers, hyphens, and underscores are allowed\. This name is referenced in the `sourceVolume` parameter of container definition `mountPoints`\.

`dockerVolumeConfiguration`  
Type: Object  
Required: No  
This parameter is specified when using Docker volumes\. Docker volumes are only supported when using the EC2 launch type\. Windows containers only support the use of the `local` driver\. To use bind mounts, specify a `host` instead\.    
`scope`  
Type: String  
Valid Values: `task` \| `shared`  
Required: No  
The scope for the Docker volume, which determines its lifecycle\. Docker volumes that are scoped to a `task` are automatically provisioned when the task starts and destroyed when the task stops\. Docker volumes that are scoped as `shared` persist after the task stops\.  
`autoprovision`  
Type: Boolean  
Default value: `false`  
Required: No  
If this value is `true`, the Docker volume is created if it does not already exist\.  
This field is only used if the `scope` is `shared`\.  
`driver`  
Type: String  
Required: No  
The Docker volume driver to use\. The driver value must match the driver name provided by Docker because it is used for task placement\. If the driver was installed using the Docker plugin CLI, use `docker plugin ls` to retrieve the driver name from your container instance\. If the driver was installed using another method, use Docker plugin discovery to retrieve the driver name\. For more information, see [Docker plugin discovery](https://docs.docker.com/engine/extend/plugin_api/#plugin-discovery)\. This parameter maps to `Driver` in the [Create a volume](https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.35/#operation/VolumeCreate) section of the [Docker Remote API](https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.35/) and the `--driver` option to [https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/volume_create/](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/volume_create/)\.  
`driverOpts`  
Type: String  
Required: No  
A map of Docker driver specific options to pass through\. This parameter maps to `DriverOpts` in the [Create a volume](https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.35/#operation/VolumeCreate) section of the [Docker Remote API](https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.35/) and the `--opt` option to [https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/volume_create/](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/volume_create/)\.  
`labels`  
Type: String  
Required: No  
Custom metadata to add to your Docker volume\. This parameter maps to `Labels` in the [Create a volume](https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.35/#operation/VolumeCreate) section of the [Docker Remote API](https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.35/) and the `--label` option to [https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/volume_create/](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/volume_create/)\.

`mountPoints`  
Type: Object  
Required: No  
The mount points for data volumes in your container\.   
This parameter maps to `Volumes` in the [Create a container](https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.35/#create-a-container) section of the [Docker Remote API](https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.35/) and the `--volume` option to [https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/run/](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/run/)\.  
Windows containers can mount whole directories on the same drive as `$env:ProgramData`\. Windows containers cannot mount directories on a different drive, and mount point cannot be across drives\.    
`sourceVolume`

## Examples<a name="docker-volume-examples"></a>

**To provide nonpersistent storage for a container using a Docker volume**

In this example, you want a container to use an empty data volume that you aren't interested in keeping after the task has finished\. For example, you may have a container that need to access some scratch file storage location during a task\. This task can be achieved using either a Docker volume\.

1. In the task definition `volumes` section, define a data volume with `name` and `DockerVolumeConfiguration` values\. In this example, we specify the scope as `task` so the volume will deleted once the task stops, set autoprovision to `true` so the volume will be created for us, and use the built\-in `local` driver\.

   ```
   "volumes": [
       {
           "name": "scratch",
           "dockerVolumeConfiguration" : {
               "scope": "task",
               "autoprovision": true,
               "driver": "local",
               "labels": {
                   "scratch: space"
               }
           }
       }
   ]
   ```

1. In the `containerDefinitions` section, define a container with `mountPoints` that reference the name of the defined volume and the `containerPath` value to mount the volume at on the container\.

   ```
   "containerDefinitions": [
       {
           "name": "container-1",
           "mountPoints": [
               {
                 "sourceVolume": "scratch",
                 "containerPath": "/var/scratch"
               }
           ]
       }
   ]
   ```

**To provide persistent storage for a container using a Docker volume**

In this example, you want a shared volume for multiple containers to use and you want it to persist after any single task using it has stopped\. The built\-in `local` driver is being used so the volume will still be tied to the lifecycle of the container instance\.

1. In the task definition `volumes` section, define a data volume with `name` and `DockerVolumeConfiguration` values\. In this example, we will specify a `shared` scope so the volume will persist, set autoprovision to `true` so the volume will be created for us, and use the built\-in `local` driver\.

   ```
   "volumes": [
       {
           "name": "database",
           "dockerVolumeConfiguration" : {
               "scope": "shared",
               "autoprovision": true,
               "driver": "local",
               "labels": {
                   "database: database_name"
               }
           }
       }
   ]
   ```

1. In the `containerDefinitions` section, define a container with `mountPoints` that reference the name of the defined volume and the `containerPath` value to mount the volume at on the container\.

   ```
   "containerDefinitions": [
       {
           "name": "container-1",
           "mountPoints": [
           {
             "sourceVolume": "database",
             "containerPath": "/var/database"
           }
         ]
       },
       {
         "name": "container-2",
         "mountPoints": [
           {
             "sourceVolume": "database",
             "containerPath": "/var/database"
           }
         ]
       }
     ]
   ```
